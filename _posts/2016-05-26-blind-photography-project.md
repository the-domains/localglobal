"Blind Photography Project"

Enabling visually impaired people to appropriate the city

**  
  
**

What?

Photography by the visually impaired is in the remotest of our imagination and most of us are unaware that they can also see, they just do it differently. We live in a world of digital explosion, visual culture is produced and consumed by sighted people while blind people are labeled as "non visual". Being visual is not about what you (can actually) see, but what you perceive. 

**  
**

Cities are not only about what we see but how we move, what we smell, the influence of sound, how we interact with others. My visual perception and orientation in the city depends absolutely on what I see. But how does a blind person take photos? How does space influences us? Would we behave differently in another environment? I come from Caracas and I wonder how hard it would be for a blind person to interact in Latin American cities. Are cities in Europe more inclusive?

Who?

Alejandra Loreto began with The Blind Photography Project last year, as part of the program of 'Social Design -- Arts as Urban Innovation' at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. She studied architecture in Caracas (Universidad Simón Bolívar) and did an exchange year at Stuttgart Universität. She is also a photographer. Travelling and living abroad has been part of her life and her camera has been her testimony. Through Verein Blickkontakt (Vienna), she has found three visually impaired project partners and go on photo sessions in the city of Vienna -- Angela, Aaron, Mathias. She shows them how to use a camera and they show her other ways to see.

How?

Photography is used as a mean of establishing contact, to get sighted people to think about blindness, break people's perception of the blind and respect them as able individuals. It is the excuse for walking the city of Vienna, to connect the islands of their mental maps, to give additional information about the city which they were not able to see without photography.

"Sighted people are very visual. Generally a good way to get their attention is through their eyes" says Angela Engels, a sociologist living in Aspern and part of the project \[...\] This project has given sense on what I'm seeing. It gives me a reason to remember. It gives the city an additional value" (Angela).

Why? 

Blind people can listen to the height of ceilings and walls, materials of floor, know when there is an entrance close. They cannot listen to electric cars. Winter makes everything more difficult. Their bodies cannot feel radiation because of all the layers and, when there is snow, they cannot feel the guidelines of the floor. Acoustics also change with snow. Buying food is also difficult. Technology plays a big role in their lives and replaced sighted people. They know perfectly the Vienna transportation system and sometimes use a GPS. 

**  
**

When we do photos, we walk more than 5km. Visually impaired get a better idea of the distances in the city and connect places they did not know were so close by walking. "You have to find out too many things on your own before going or you need a sighted person to guide you". 

**  
**

A photograph is an input, interesting yes, but not a conclusion. The Blind Photography Project provides cues on how we can design cities, how can we strengthen the use of our other senses, how can we make cities livable and more inclusive. Can we change cities with projects like this? I use a phrase from Kevin Lynch's book 

The Image of the city

"A clear image of the surroundings is thus a useful basis for individual growth". A more inclusive city will enable and reinforce individual empowerment and social cohesion.
